# Golang Microservice Project

## Overview
This project is a Golang-based microservice architecture designed to provide scalable and maintainable services for [insert project purpose, e.g., user management, payment processing, etc.]. It leverages Go's concurrency model and standard libraries to ensure high performance and simplicity.

## Features
- **Modular Design**: Each microservice is independent and handles a specific business capability.
- **RESTful APIs**: Services expose endpoints following REST principles.
- **Database Integration**: Supports [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB] for persistent storage.
- **Authentication**: Implements JWT-based authentication for secure access.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Integrated with [e.g., Zap, Prometheus] for observability.
- **Dockerized**: Services are containerized for easy deployment.

## Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- [Database, e.g., PostgreSQL] installed or running in a container
- [Optional: any other tools, e.g., Kubernetes, make]

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project.git
   cd project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example`:
   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_USER=admin
   DB_PASSWORD=secret
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   ```

### Running the Services
1. Start the database and other dependencies using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Run a specific microservice:
   ```bash
   go run cmd/service-name/main.go
   ```

3. Alternatively, build and run all services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Testing
Run unit tests:
```bash
go test ./... -v
```

### API Documentation
API endpoints are documented using [e.g., Swagger, Postman collection]. Access the documentation at:
- [Link to Swagger UI or external docs, e.g., `http://localhost:8080/swagger`]

## Deployment
1. Build Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-service-name .
   ```

2. Deploy to [e.g., Kubernetes, AWS ECS]:
   - Update `k8s/` manifests or use your deployment tool.
   - Example for Kubernetes:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f k8s/
     ```

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add your feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
5. Open a pull request.
